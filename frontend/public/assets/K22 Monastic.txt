K22 Monastic

K22 Monastic is based on Monastic from the Victorian Display Alphabets by 
Dan X. Solo (Dover Publications), scanned and posted by Poukha in 
alt.binaries.fonts on March 17, 2010.

The Monastic specimen sheet from Victorian Display Alphabets only contains 
alphabets. Claude posted an image of the numerals and several cyrillic 
characters  in alt.binaries.fonts on March 19, 2010. Severak numerals were 
also taken from the McKellar, Smiths & Jordan 1892 specimen book.

The font only contains characters that are on the Poukha scan and Claude's 
images. I did not create any characters from scratch.

Thanks to Poukha and Claude for posting the materials used in the font.
